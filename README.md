# Machine-Learning-Demo-4

We give an example of how to train a variational auto-encoder on synthetic data, and then implement the VAE on a binarized MNIST digits dataset. We then train a generative model to predict the bottom half of a digit image given the top half, and give ways to optimize the model by tuning parameters.
